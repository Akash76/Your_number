# Your_number

  Magic is the art of creating illusions. Some of the card tricks can be traced mathematically.

Your_number is such trick which involves the volunteer to remember a number in a range of 15 numbers and the number can be made to appear on the screen in just 3 inputs.

# Explanation

  Once the volunteer memorised a number, the 15 numbers are arranged in three rows with 5 in each.
Then the programmer asks him/her to tell in which row the number in their mind is! Making it as input the program loops for 2 more times.

The last press reveals the number in their Mind!!!

# Trick_Revealed

  The selected row of numbers is sandwiched in between the remaining two rows and thus forming 15 numbers again in different fashion. 8th number after three selected rows will be the number in mind.
